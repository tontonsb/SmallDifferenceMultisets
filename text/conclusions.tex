Although this topic seems far from complete, we have reached multiple small breakthroughs in various directions.

The case of difference multisets over $\mathbb Z_3$ (theorem \ref{v3:theorem:loeschian}) shows that not only the very trivial cases can be solved explicitly. Although it is not straightforward to generalize our methods for arbitrary $\mathbb Z_k$, solving the problem for an odd prime value of $k$ seems promising. Furthermore the discovered link to Löschian numbers might provide further insight for other difference multisets or even some new perspective on the topics now linked through Löschian numbers.

The solved $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$ is another promising direction. A new construction (theorem \ref{regular:theorem:regular}) was found generalizing ones of $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$ and it feels a general solution for $G=\prod_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb Z_2$ should be in reach soon.

And lastly, theorem \ref{general:theorem:limits} greatly narrows the space of options that has to be considered in computer searches thus allowing to inspect a wide range of difference multisets and draw conclusions through observations.
